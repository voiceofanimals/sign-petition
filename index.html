To<br>
The administrator of Chandigarh UT,<br><br>
            
            I am writing to express my grievances regarding inadequate services of SPCA Chandigarh to the animals of the region. SPCA Chandigarh, under the umbrella of Chandigarh administration, is an eyewash in the name of a hospital. Its patients don't receive adequate food or treatments, the two most important things a hospital needs to provide. 
Furthermore, inadequate budgetary provisions and terrible management cripple the system. A system which further tries to plug all its loopholes by blaming it all on its own citizen volunteers/activists for reporting it.
<br><br>
 <i>I request the office of the honourable administrator to intervene for correction and we have the following suggestions to put SPCA Chandigarh on the path of self-correction:</i><br>
<br>
    1. SPCA should be subjected to annual assessments for provisioning for medicines, diagnosis, employees (like skilled surgeons), medical equipment, dietary needs of the sick and healthy animals and sanitation activities.<br><br>
            
    2. All past complaints should be reviewed to see how many of them are resolved successfully in letter and spirit.<br><br>
            
    3. SPCA Chandigarh should duly be notified by Chandigarh administration with rules and guidelines. Position of at least one permanent (non-contractual) veterinary surgeon should be created by the administration.<br><br>
            
    4. <b>Poor management and excessive centralization of SPCA Chandigarh at the office of Joint Director of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Chandigarh cum General Secretary -SPCA Chandigarh should be dissolved to a more decentralized model for greater systemic efficiency over the long term with much-required checks and balances.</b><br><br>    
                
    5. SPCA Chandigarh should ensure proper care and treatment of wildlife animals. The Department of Forests and Wildlife should be involved in the decision-making process of the organisation as wild animals have notably high mortality rates at the shelter.<br><br>
            
    6. We request you in the most urgent manner to form a public committee that looks into financial discrepancies, Shelter mismanagement and the high mortality rate at SPCA Chandigarh. We cannot stress enough on how important it is to have a common discussion model, that promotes more involvement of other state agencies like the forest and wildlife department, MC Chandigarh, local NGOs, volunteers and activists so as for the mute animals to get rightful decisions.<br><br>
            
    7. The shelter is extremely overcrowded and extension of shelter's land with more suitable infrastructure is quintessentially fundamental for any long term improvement at the shelter. Role of sanitation and engineering wings of the civic body should also be examined.<br><br>
            
   8. Sunshine laws should be promoted and rules for volunteers and activists should be jointly drafted while a sua sponte disclosures of operational and financial data should be considered. An iron curtain of data is substantially harming all the animals admitted at SPCA Chandigarh while volunteers and activists are facing harassment for filing complaints and RTI's<br><br>
I look forward to a responsible and urgent action from your end and at the same time, we humbly request you to visit and inspect SPCA Chandigarh's shelter and take cognizance of the present situation.
<br><br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
A Concerned Citizen
